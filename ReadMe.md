- Solution is made to work for part 1 using Jersey.
- It retrieves all cars from 3 suppliers and gives best opptions.
- I was using Intellij, pom file is provided.
- To start application please run App.java.
- If the socket do not respond in 2000 milliseconds, an exception will be thrown, to show the error.

- Part 2:
	- I will be honest it was the first time I was doing RestAPI + Tomcat, and I believe, I failed.
	- Solution idea should work, however, I was struggling with configuration and dependencies. 
	- Many dependencies did not fully work out for part two. 
	- I still added my solution.
	- I was running Tomcat as local server.
	
Conclusion, thank you for such a great experience, learning new things and developing. 
I will be over the moon if I get to second round.
